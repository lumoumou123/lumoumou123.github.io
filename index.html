        <p>Restaurant Management and Rating System</p>
        <p>With digital transformation well underway, the factors people use to select and review dining
             experiences have changed significantly. Conventional word-of-mouth recommendations and reviews 
             are not enough to satisfy the demands of the contemporary consumer. The restaurant rating system targe
             ts to address this gap with a large platform that helps users find, score, and review eateries in their area. 
             The system combines the location services of Google Maps and not only searches and filters restaurants by type, 
             price, and rating but also allows users to leave feedback via a rating system. The project strives to utilize current web 
             technologies in order to improve the user experience and accelerate the process of finding new restaurants.</p>
